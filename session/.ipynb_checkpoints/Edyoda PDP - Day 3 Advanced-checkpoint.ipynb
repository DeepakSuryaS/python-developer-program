    "- filter\n",
    "    - The filter() method constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true. In simple words, the filter() method filters the given iterable with the help of a function that tests each element in the iterable to be true or not.\n",

    "## Generators\n",
    "\n",
    "A generator is a function that returns an object (iterator) which we can iterate over (one value at a time).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of overhead in building an iterator in Python; we have to implement a class with __iter__() and __next__() method, keep track of internal states, raise StopIteration when there was no values to be returned etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is both lengthy and counter intuitive. Generator comes into rescue in such situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python generators are a simple way of creating iterators. All the overhead we mentioned above are automatically handled by generators in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is fairly simple to create a generator in Python. It is as easy as defining a normal function with yield statement instead of a return statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a function contains at least one yield statement (it may contain other yield or return statements), it becomes a generator function. Both yield and return will return some value from a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference is that, while a return statement terminates a function entirely, yield statement pauses the function saving all its states and later continues from there on successive calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference between a regular function and a generator function:\n",
    "- Generator function contains one or more yield statement.\n",
    "- When called, it returns an object (iterator) but does not start execution immediately.\n",
    "- Methods like __iter__() and __next__() are implemented automatically. So we can iterate through the items using next().\n",
    "- Once the function yields, the function is paused and the control is transferred to the caller.\n",
    "- Local variables and their states are remembered between successive calls. But in a regular function, states are not maintained.\n",
    "- Finally, when the function terminates, StopIteration is raised automatically on further calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators usage will save memory because instead of generating an entire sequence of results, we're generating results one by one as required.\n"

    "- Object.\n",
    "- Class.\n",
    "- Method.\n",
    "- Inheritance.\n",
    "- Polymorphism.\n",
    "- Data Abstraction.\n",
    "- Encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages:\n",
    "- The programming gets easy and efficient.\n",
    "- The class is sharable, so codes can be reused.\n",
    "- The productivity of programmars increases\n",
    "- Data is safe and secure with data abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class:\n",
    "- A class is a blueprint of the object\n",
    "- It contains all the description of the object\n",
    "- An instance is a specific object created from a particular class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Object:\n",
    "- Object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data.\n",
    "- An object is an instantiation of a class.\n",
    "- When class is defined, only the description for the object is defined. Therefore, no memory or storage is allocated.\n",
    "- Class attributes are same for all instances of a class.\n",
    "- Instance attributes are different for every instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method:\n",
    "- Functions defined inside the body of a class.\n",
    "- They are used to define the behaviors of an object.\n",
    "- Instance methods are methods that are called on an instance object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encapsulation:\n",
    "- We can restrict access to methods and variables using encapsulation.\n",
    "- Prevents data from direct modification.\n",
    "- We define private attributes using __ or _ as a prefix.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Instance Methods\n",
    "    Through the self parameter, instance methods can freely access attributes and other methods on the same object. This gives them a lot of power when it comes to modifying an object’s state. Not only can they modify object state, instance methods can also access the class itself through the self.__class__ attribute. This means instance methods can also modify class state.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Class Methods\n",
    "    Instead of accepting a self parameter, class methods take a cls parameter that points to the class—and not the object instance—when the method is called. Because the class method only has access to this cls argument, it can’t modify object instance state. That would require access to self. However, class methods can still modify class state that applies across all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Static Methods\n",
    "    This type of method takes neither a self nor a cls parameter (but of course it’s free to accept an arbitrary number of other parameters). Therefore a static method can neither modify object state nor class state. Static methods are restricted in what data they can access - and they’re primarily a way to namespace your methods.\n"
